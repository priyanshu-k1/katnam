## About

This is a small, fun front-end project that allows you to playfully "calculate" the hypothetical katnam (dowry) amount. *Please note that this project is purely for entertainment purposes and does not endorse or encourage the practice of dowry, which is illegal and harmful.*

Think of it as a lighthearted way to explore different factors and see how they might (again, hypothetically and humorously) influence a fictional katnam value.

## Features

* *Interactive Input Fields:* Enter various (again, purely hypothetical and fun) criteria.
* *Dynamic Calculation:* See the "calculated" katnam amount update in real-time based on your inputs.
* *Simple and User-Friendly Interface:* Easy to use for anyone looking for a bit of amusement.
* *Front-End Only:* Built with web technologies (likely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for a straightforward experience.
## Disclaimer

*This project is intended for entertainment purposes only.* The concept of dowry is a serious social issue and is illegal in many countries, including India. This calculator is not meant to be taken seriously and should not be used to perpetuate or normalize the practice of dowry.

## Contributing

As this is a small, personal project created for fun, contributions are not actively being sought at this time. However, if you have any minor suggestions or find a small bug, feel free to open an issue.
*Enjoy the playful exploration! Remember, this is all in good fun and not to be taken seriously.*
